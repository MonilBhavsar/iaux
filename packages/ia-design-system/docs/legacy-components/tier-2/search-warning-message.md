An attention-grabbing message providing advisory information about an otherwise successful search query or the current state of the search engine.

![Info icon with a warning message saying that the search engine had to modify the user’s query](../../../images/search-warning-message.png)

## Sub-Components
- [Icon](../tier-1/icon)
- Paragraph

## Do
- Place the error message on its own row/line.
- Ensure there is ample vertical space between the message text and surrounding elements.

## Don’t
- Use this component when the search fails to produce results. For search failures, use the [Search Error Message](search-error-message).
- Use any other colors, like yellow or orange. Warning messages should use the standard off-black text color.

## See Also
- [Search Error Message](search-error-message)

## TODO
- Potentially generalize Search Messages to create a pattern for all error/warning messages.
