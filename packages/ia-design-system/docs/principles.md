## Digital native
The Internet Archive was born of the Web and thus reflects and elevates Web standards. We are not constrained by the rules of print design and embrace the fluidity of the Web.

## Universal access to all
We embrace the diversity of our users and their devices and strive for inclusion and accessibility. Content is expressed legibly and with clear structure and hierarchy. We support non-English and non-LTR languages.

## Transparent and trustworthy
Content is free to access without advertising or surveillance. We prioritize content that benefits the user over content that benefits the organization. Content is permanent and traceable.

## Content is elevated
We present content in a neutral context, with display optimized for its type. The system maintains a complete archive; metadata and relationships are preserved and easily accessible.

## Create your own journey
Users are encouraged to explore, discover, and even add and curate their own content. They can “take content home” and interact with it on their own terms. Personalization is available but is firmly under the user’s control.
