## Tiers
Components are organized using the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) methodology, albeit with modified names for some of the hierarchical levels.

- **Tier 1:** ”Foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces,” such as brand colors, type sizes, built-in HTML elements, and small, indivisible components like icons. The equivalent of “Atoms.”
- **Tier 2:** ”Relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit,” such as search bars and accordions. The equivalent of “Molecules.”
- **Tier 3:** “Relatively complex UI components composed of groups” of other components, such as nav bars and grid views. The equivalent of “Organisms.”
- **Templates:** “Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.” Each major page on a site should have its own Template.
- **Pages:** “Specific instances of Templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.” These help demonstrate how Templates work when using real content, but before they are fully deployed to production.
